This project presents the final assignment for the OOP course (CS.Ariel 2021).
In this assignment we designed a “Pokémon game” in which given a weighted graph, a set of “Agents” should be located on it so they could “catch” as many “Pokémon” as possible.
The pokémons are located on the graph’s (directed) edges, therefore, the agent needs to take (aka walk) the proper edge to “grab” the pokémon. The goal is to maximize the overall sum of weights of the “grabbed” pokémons.
